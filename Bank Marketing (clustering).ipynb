One of those services is the term deposit, which restricts withdrawing the deposit until the term ends. This deposit allows a higher flexibility in budget management because it doesn't affect the \"liquidity coverage ratio\" (the amount of money that the bank has to be able to pay instantly). In this project marketing segmentation will be done.\n\n## Goal\nThe goal is to divide all clients into distinct market segments by answering the following questions:\n* By which distinct features each segment can be characterized?\n* What type of customers marketing team should focus on for their next marketing campaign?\n\n# Data Collection\n## Data Source\nI used \"Bank Marketing\" dataset from Kaggle provided by user Henrique Yamahata.
